      If you’re reading this, chances are you <b>care a lot about fighting climate change</b>, and that’s great. Maybe you’re thinking about making a donation to the cause as you watch wildfires burning in California, ice shelves shattering in the
      Arctic, and
      glaciers breaking loose in Antarctica, all at the same time.</p>

    <p>
      Climate change is the biggest emergency facing humanity. Our global response to it has been, in a word, pathetic. Over the past decade, <b>our carbon dioxide emissions have actually risen 11 percent</b>. We need to reverse that trend — and
      fast.

      The trouble is, it can be genuinely hard to figure out how to direct your money wisely if you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There’s a glut of environmental organizations out there and a lack of rigorous research on their impacts and
      cost-effectiveness, though that’s beginning to change with the arrival of new evaluators like <b>Giving Green and ImpactMatters.</b>
